Ares IV was the fourth mission in the Ares program. Ares IV was delayed two years because of Mark Watney's premature launch of Ares IV's MAV to the Hermes, they had to send a new MAV with a robotic Hermes run. The mission's goals were like the first three missions but they also studied the rovers of Watney's rescue.
