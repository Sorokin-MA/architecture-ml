Ares V was the fifth mission to Mars, but the fifth mission in the Ares program. Much like the previous missions, it's goal was to conduct experiments on the planet's surface with six astronauts. Ares V was the first time where an astronaut, Rick Martinez, returned to the planet's surface for a second time.
