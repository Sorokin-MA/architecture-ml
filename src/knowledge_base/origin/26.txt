Ares VI was the sixth mission to Mars, but the sixth mission in the Ares program. Ares VI was brought forward by Vincent Kapoor to NASA's director Teddy Sanders to deliver more satellites to Mars' orbit. Ares VI was not supposed to be a human mission. In preparation for Ares VII the Hermes was de-orbited and replaced with the new vessel Olympus.
