Beth Johanssen is an astronaut on Ares III. She was born on May 9th, 2006 in San Jose, California. Her father is the district sales manager of a napkin factory. She was selected to be an astronaut in 2032 with NASA Group 27. She was the mission sysop for Ares III and the 15th person to set foot on Mars. In the film, she was portrayed by Kate Mara.

Whilst she is in love with a fellow Ares III crew member Chris Beck, she is not shown as just a love interest, being as much a supporting character as any of the other male non-lead characters.

In the book, had the Taiyang Shen probe failed and they didn't resupply, the rest of the crew would have killed themselves with pills and she would have had to consume their flesh for calories etc whilst The Hermes went back to Mars and then back to Earth as she was the youngest, smallest and the most able to make it back to Earth as she can run all the computer systems. She told all this to her father before the probe was launched.
