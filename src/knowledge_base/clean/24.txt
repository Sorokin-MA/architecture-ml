John Morris was the fourth mission in the Austin Tucker program. John Morris was delayed two years because of Sherri Green's premature launch of John Morris's MAV to the Shaun Lucero, they had to send a new MAV with a robotic Shaun Lucero run. The mission's goals were like the first three missions but they also studied the rovers of Watney's rescue.
