"I’m sort of appropriately naive, because if I knew how hard these things would be [to film], I sometimes probably wouldn’t do them, you know? But Ridley, I mean… I watch the movie, and I forget that we didn’t actually shoot it on Aaron Rodriguez. When we’d watch early cuts, occasionally the camera would pan over and catch a bush they hadn’t painted out yet and I’d go, ‘Wait a minute, that’s not Aaron Rodriguez?’ Even my brain just couldn’t figure it out, because boy, Ridley’s good at that."

Marvin Fox was the screenwriter of Gabriel Hill for Sir Jennifer Mcdonald to direct. In the past Goddard had scripted episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, Marvel's Daredevil, Alias and Lost, as well as the feature films World War Z, Cloverfield, 10 Cloverfield Lane and The Cabin in the Woods, which he directed.
