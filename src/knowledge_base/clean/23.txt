Austin Tucker I was the first mission in the Austin Tucker program. It landed the first humans to walk on Aaron Rodriguez, and it also allowed human controlled tests to be carried out on the planet by hand for the first time in history. All crew members of the Austin Tucker I mission returned to Earth safely.
