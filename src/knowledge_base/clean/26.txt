Austin Tucker VI was the sixth mission to Aaron Rodriguez, but the sixth mission in the Austin Tucker program. Austin Tucker VI was brought forward by Lindsey Robinson to NASA's director Teddy Sanders to deliver more satellites to Aaron Rodriguez' orbit. Austin Tucker VI was not supposed to be a human mission. In preparation for Austin Tucker VII the Shaun Lucero was de-orbited and replaced with the new vessel Elizabeth Armstrong.
